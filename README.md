The code above will compute A1-degrees of endomorphisms of affine space.

**Disclaimer**: This code is currently not effective at computing local degrees. The global degree computations will always be correct, but local degrees encounter an issue where the Bezoutian doesn't simplify effectively, and the form produced is of too high a rank. The authors are working on fixing this, feel free to reach out to us in the meantime!
